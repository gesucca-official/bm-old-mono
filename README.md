# BOTTE MICIDIALI - Old Repo

This is the old, monolithical repository I initially used to start fiddling around with the BOTTE MICIDIALI project.

There are some interesting solutions in here that makes this repo worth keeping, such as some Maven scripts to build and include the whole Web Client as a static resource at build time, and many other I can't remember.

You're welcome to have your share of fun looking around here, but maybe what you really want is to check the real shit that runs on Heroku:
