# Rules

Someday I will write them

## Basic Action: Grab

The Basic Action *Grab* targets an Object *on **any** Side the Field*.

- When a Player targets an Object on *his side* of the Field with Grab, the Action is treated as a regular Action Card and its effect is replaced by the targeted Object's effect.
- When a Player targets an Object on *his opponent's Side of the Field* with Grab, it is treated as an Action Card with *Low Priority (-1)* ???and its effect is to move targeted Object on the Player's Side of the Field???.

pay an alertness cost when I grab other's objects??

## Object Types

There are three type of Object Cards:

- *Consumable Objects*: when they are used by Grab, they apply their effects and then are Discarded.
- *Durable Objects*: they can be used by Grab, but they return to the Side of the Field where they were Grabbed after their use. They can also have Static Effects.
- *Equippable Objects*: when they are Grabbed, they remain equipped to the Character and provides Equip Status(es).
