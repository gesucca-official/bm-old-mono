# Object Cards

*Object Cards* are cards that represents objects that can be placed on the Field and can be grabbed by Characters.

An Object Card has to be placed on the Field before it can be used. When a Player draws an Object card, he can immediately place it on *his Side of the Field*. If he choses not to, the Object Card is treated as any other Card that Player has in his Hand.

A Player can use a *Basic Action* (represented by the card **Grab**) to get hold on an Object on the Field and use his effects.

## Basic Action: Grab

The Basic Action *Grab* targets an Object *on **any** Side the Field*.

- When a Player targets an Object on *his side* of the Field with Grab, the Action is treated as a regular Action Card and its effect is replaced by the targeted Object's effect.
- When a Player targets an Object on *his opponent's Side of the Field* with Grab, it is treated as an Action Card with *Low Priority (-1)* ???and its effect is to move targeted Object on the Player's Side of the Field???.

pay an alertness cost when I grab other's objects??

## Object Types

There are three type of Object Cards:

- *Consumable Objects*: when they are used by Grab, they apply their effects and then are Discarded.
- *Durable Objects*: they can be used by Grab, but they return to the Side of the Field where they were Grabbed after their use. They can also have Static Effects.
- *Equippable Objects*: when they are Grabbed, they remain equipped to the Character and provides Equip Status(es).
