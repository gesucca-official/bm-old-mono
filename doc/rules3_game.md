## Playing the Game

Each Player starts the Game with a Deck of 20 Cards (Regular Action Cards and Object Cards).

- **Hidden Information**: Deck Cards' order is unknown to every Player, and each Player's Cards in Hand are known only
  to that particular Player.
- **Public Information**: every other aspect of the Game (Characters' Resources and Items on the Field) is known to
  everyone in the Game.

The Game begins with each Player having in Hand their predefined 2 Character-Bound Cards, their predefined Basic Action
Card, and 3 Regular Action Cards drawn from their shuffled Deck. If any Object Cards are drawn this way, they are
immediatly placed nearby that Player's Character.

### Making a Move

At the same time, each Player forms a Move by choosing an Action Card among those in their Hand and a Target for it.
Once all Players have submitted their Moves to the Game, they are Resolved.

### Moves Resolution

Moves are ordered by each Character's Alertness Resource, and then resolved. Change of Alertness that happens during
Moves resolution are not taken into consideration until the next resolution (i.e., *next turn*).

### Game Over

After each Moves Resolution, if only one Character's Health Resource is greater than 0 (i.e. if only one thug is *still
alive*), that Character's Player wins the Game. If no Character is alive at the end of the turn, the Game is a Draw and
no one wins.
