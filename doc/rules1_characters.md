## Characters

Characters are represented through Characters Cards. 

### Resources

Each Character has a starting set of Resources that can be expended to pay Move Costs or saved to impacts the game in particular ways. 

There are two main Resources:

- **Health**: it represents the Character's health level. When it falls below 0, the Character no longer able to fight (i.e. is dead).
- **Alertness**: it represents the Character's responsiveness to what is happening in the Battlefield. The more Alertness a Character has, the more he/she is likely to Move first.

Each Character can start the game with some amount of one or more Special Resources, described and explained on the Character Card itself.
